# LoopBack Android SDK

As a former StrongLoop Labs project, this SDK may lack usability, completeness, documentation, and robustness, and may be outdated. StrongLoop/IBM is no longer maintaining this project actively, however we do provide support for our paying customers through usual IBM support channels.

Our recommendatios is to use [IBM Mobile First](https://www.ibm.com/mobile) platform or [Swagger codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) instead of this SDK.

We are looking for volunteers from our community to pick up the maintenance of this project, see https://github.com/strongloop-community/loopback-sdk-android/issues/123
## Description

The Android Java SDK provides simple API calls that enable your Android app to access a
[LoopBack](http://docs.strongloop.com/loopback) server application.  It enables you to interact with your 
models and data sources using a comfortable, first-class Java interface instead 
of using the clunky `AsyncHttpClient`, `JSONObject`, and similar interfaces.

See the official [LoopBack Android SDK documentation](http://loopback.io/doc/en/lb3/Android-SDK.html).
